% BCJR recursive algorithm
% For systematic convolutoinal codes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input
% app_llr: interleaved LLR of extrinsic LLR
% gamma_c: constant parts of gamma (Ck and Lcxy)
% transitions: 2-dimensional array to describe trellis structure
%              FromState, ToState, info, c1, ..., cn
%              Start value is always 1 instead of 0
