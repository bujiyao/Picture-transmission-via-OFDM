% Input
% generator_polynomial: [[H1] ; [H2] ; ... ]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Output
% transitions: 2-dimensional array to describe trellis structure
%              FromState, ToState, input, c1, ..., cn
%              Start value is always 1 instead of 0
