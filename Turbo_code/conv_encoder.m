% Convolutional encoder
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input
% info_seq: Information sequence
% transitions: 2-dimensional array to describe trellis structure
%              FromState, ToState, info, c1, ..., cn
%              Start value is always 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Output
% encoded_seqence: Encoded bit sequences, one information to one column
